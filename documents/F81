Syrian refugees settle into new lives in Canada

In a small, crowded classroom in tiny Belleville, Ontario, Syria native Abdel Malek al-Jasem is learning some very important terms in English.
Coat, gloves, toque, scarf and boots. He scribbles them in a notebook next to their Arabic translations.
He will need all of that gear as he adjusts to life in Canada.
Jasem arrived in October of last year after four years in Lebanon, where he and his family sought refuge after bombing in their village outside of Hama, Syria, pushed them out.
He and his wife have eleven children, including two sets of twins, ranging in age from a toddler to a college-aged boy.
