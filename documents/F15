EU Welcomes Refugees With Arabic TV Channels, Mobile Apps and Newspapers

Slowly but surely the European Union is beginning to introduce newspapers and websites geared toward making refugees feel more at home in Europe. RT took a closer look at what has been done so far.

A number of EU member states, including Germany, Sweden, Austria, Greece and the Netherlands, are helping newcomers adapt better and feel more at home on European soil.

Germany and the Netherlands, for example, introduced TV channels and newspapers in Arabic aimed at integrating Middle Eastern and African refugees into German and Dutch society.

These newspapers and TV channels, geared toward migrants, have booklets in Arabic that help the refugees understand their host country, its customs and its oft-complex administrative system.

Germany has also launched mobile apps to helps refugees learn German.

There are now also supermarkets in Europe with signs in Arabic to make refugees feel more comfortable when shopping.

These welcoming policies aren't taken lightly by many EU citizens, especially the followers of right-wing populist parties and movements, who see the influx of refugees as a potential threat that might eventually de-stabilize European society.

Europe is currently facing a large-scale refugee crisis. Since January of 2015, over one million refugees have arrived in Europe, fleeing violence and poverty in the Middle East and North Africa.
