George Clooney And Wife Featured In IRC Syrian Refugee Crisis Video

George Clooney and his wife, Amal appeared on a March 15 IRC video talking to Syrian refugees in an effort to make the world aware of their plight.

Time reported that Clooney’s couple video interview was supervised by the International Rescue Committee (IRC). A woman in a particular segment narrated how they witnessed a man getting shot. She also said that the man eventually died because they could not take him to the hospital.

A father told the Clooney’s how life in Syria has become a constant struggle for survival. Any person out on the street should always be wary of gunfire and snipers. Another man also recounted his harrowing experience of torture.

A Syrian mother told of relentless fighting going on in her country. Bombs from both sides of the conflict threatened to kill her family. The mother prayed that they would rather die by bullets than being beheaded.

George Clooney himself told the Syrians of his Irish immigrant roots. He told them that his ancestors had an initial rough time fitting in American society. They were eventually integrated and  became part of the mainstream.

Clooney laments that the U.S. today seemed to have set up barriers against new immigrants. He said that America has forgotten the fact that it is a nation of immigrants.

Amal Clooney also shared the story of her family living  in Lebanon which was in the midst of civil war at that time. Her family eventually settled in Great Britain to escape the fighting. It was only in recent years that some of her relatives were able to return to Lebanon. She expressed the same hope that the refugees will be able to go back to their homeland.

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has reported that an estimated 5 million or more Syrian refugees have fled their home country.
