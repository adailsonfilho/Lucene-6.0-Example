LDS Church launches 'I Was a Stranger' campaign encouraging support of refugees

The "I Was a Stranger" campaign asks readers the question "What can we do to reach out, to love, to nurture, and to minister as He has invited us to do?"

In a letter from the Church Presidency, leaders encourage members of the Church's Relief Society, Young Women and Primary organizations and information to get involved with refugee relief efforts.

"We remind Latter-day Saints throughout the world that one of the fundamental principles of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ is to 'impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants' (Mosiah 4:26)," states the First Presidency letter.

The campaign launched just two days after thousands of women packed the LDS Conference Center Saturday evening for the Women's session of the 186th annual General Conference, during which speakers encouraged the faithful to help refugees.
