Trump: Obama's "Open Door" Policy With Syrian Refugees "Could Lead To Downfall Of The Greatest Nation On Earth"

Donald Trump talks the National Enquirer story on Ted Cruz, President Obama welcoming more Syrian refugees, NATO, Brussels and more in a Monday morning interview on FOX & Friends. Transcript, via FOX News:

TRUMP: I’ll tell you what I say… I can’t believe that [President Obama] is saying it, it’s inconceivable that he’s saying it; open borders, everything he said there is absolutely, you’d almost disgraceful you can't even imagine that a man would say this, especially a president of this country. We need protection, we need borders, we need on the southern borders, we need the wall, the wall to get built and Mexico’s gonna pay for the wall by the way just in case anybody has any questions and it’s disgraceful that he could say this especially when he talks about coming in from the Middle East, frankly even more so when they’re undocumented, we have no idea where they come from, we have no idea who they are. And you saw what, a few months ago in California you saw what two radicalized young people could do, the two people got married, killed their coworkers. It is just insane what this man is saying...

I’m shocked by [John Kerry] and I’m shocked that he would sign the Iran deal which is one of the dumbest deals I’ve ever seen negotiated - a horrible, horrible embarrassment deal. I’m shocked by his policy of open door. I’m shocked by just about everything that he’s done and everything that president Obama has done that’s leading this country down. Not only are we making horrible trade deals with almost every country we do business with – I think I can absolutely say every country we do business with. We’re losing our jobs, we're losing everything, but in terms of security this open door policy is catastrophic and it's going to lead – you talk about downfall, this could lead to the downfall of the greatest nation on earth.
