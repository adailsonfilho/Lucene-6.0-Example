Café Society - New Woody Allen Movie, Will Open Cannes Festival

According to a news release, “the film tells the story of a young man who arrives in Hollywood during the 1930s hoping to work in the film industry, falls in love, and finds himself swept up in the vibrant cafe society that defined the spirit of the age.” The cast also includes Steve Carell, Blake Lively and Parker Posey.

The movie will be released in French theaters the same day that it screens at Cannes. Amazon has acquired the North American rights to “Café Society,” and after its theatrical release will make it available exclusively to Amazon Prime members. Amazon has also signed Mr. Allen to write and direct a streaming television series.

This is the third time that a film by Mr. Allen has opened the Cannes festival. He also opened in 2002, with “Hollywood Ending,” and again in 2011 with “Midnight in Paris.”

“Café Society” will be screened outside of the competition lineup, and will thus not compete for the festival’s top prize, the Palme d’Or.
