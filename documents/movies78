Summer movie preview- Unlikely BFFs bring it on

Whether you’re saving the world, solving a case, trying to stay alive on an alien planet or busting ghosts, it’s nice to have a friend or a few by your side. And sometimes they come from the unlikeliest of places.

This summer at the cinema, some of the biggest movies around will showcase BFFs and teammates who have to work together for the common good and our entertainment. It’s not as fun with just one hero around, and there’s definitely an art to crafting these kinds of films.
“It’s not making it feel like a formula … where everything’s fish out of water, one’s this, one’s that, one eats crappy food, the other’s a health-food nut,” says The Nice Guys co-writer and director Shane Black, who has been putting together big-screen team-ups since Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in Lethal Weapon.

Here are 10 sets of movie characters this summer whose opposites attract in the best of ways.
Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) were childhood friends when they joined the Army in World War II, but they became enemies in modern times after Steve spent 70 years encased in ice as Captain America and Bucky was turned into the brainwashed assassin Winter Soldier. Now, with Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and the government after them, they’re the only family they’ve got. “Bucky was always looking out for him when Steve was a smaller weak kid who needed direction and guidance,” Stan says. “Steve’s become the caretaking parent and Bucky is more of an unstable child now — someone who’s really struggling to have more of a sense of identity and is totally lost and confused with who he is.”
