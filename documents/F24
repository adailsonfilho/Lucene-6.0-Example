IceDogs donate tickets to refugees because it's the right thing to do

The owners of the Niagara IceDogs say donating over 150 tickets to Saturday's playoff game to Syrian refugees was the right thing to do.

Bill Burke tells CKTB News he got the idea after hearing news that close to 200 refugees living in Hamilton hotels were being shuttled to St.Catharines to make room for Garth Brooks fans.

The Syrian refugees were bumped from their accommodations at downtown Hamilton hotels to make way for thousands of Brooks fans.

Burke says he reached out to local officials and invited around 160 refugees to Saturday's game against Ottawa.

He says it was great to see the Syrian families enjoy the game.

 Burke says it was an honour to see the young refugees chant "Go Dogs Go".

Burke says they are always trying to help Niagara residents, schools and organizations attend games.

He says they have donated tickets to Community Care, Big Brothers Big Sisters, and various other groups over the years.

Burke says it's usually behind the scenes and they don't do it for publicity.

He says they do it because it's the right thing to do.

Residents became aware of the donation when Jeff Burch, the Executive Director of Niagara Folk Arts Multicultural Centre thanked Burke on social media.

Game three of the playoff series against the 67's is in Ottawa this afternoon.

You can hear it live on 610 CKTB with the pre-game show starting at 2:30.
