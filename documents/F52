We welcomed refugees in 1945. We can't abandon them today

Harry Leslie Smith saw the full potential of human cruelty while he was serving Britain during the second world war. But, he says, his country showed huge compassion by settling 200,000 Polish refugees in 1945. Today, however, he believes politicians are turning their backs on humanity by rejecting refugees fleeing war.
Smith will be speaking at the Bradford Literary Festival on 23 May
His book, Harryâ€™s Last Stand, is available from the Guardian Bookshop.
