Netflix is buying Hush, a low-budget horror movie premiering at SXSW

Netflix's latest movie acquisition is Hush, a micro-budget thriller from director Mike Flanagan that's premiering at SXSW this weekend. Flanagan also wrote and produced the movie, which stars co-writer Kate Siegel as a reclusive author suffering from hearing loss who's being hunted by a masked killer. (The movie also stars The Newsroom's John Gallagher Jr., Michael Trucco, and Samantha Sloyan.) Veteran horror producer Jason Blum (Unfriended, Periscope horror movie Fifteen) co-produced the movie, and he's also worked with Flanagan on projects like Oculus and the upcoming Ouija 2. Hush is going to debut in Austin on March 12th (this Saturday), and it'll be made available on Netflix on April 8th.

"Hush is a great example of what happens when you give an incredible filmmaker like Mike Flanagan creative freedom to tell a fun and original scary story," said Blum in a statement. "We had a great time continuing our relationship with Mike and Intrepid [Pictures], and are psyched to share Mike's movie with genre lovers all over the world on Netflix." Hush isn't the streaming giant's only movie debuting in Austin next week: Paul Reubens' Judd Apatow-produced comeback Pee-Wee's Big Holiday is premiering at SXSW before hitting Netflix on March 18th.
