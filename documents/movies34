Film shows plight of Christians in Iraq

A new documentary premiering in West Bloomfield Township focuses on the plight of Christians in the Middle East — a people who have been persecuted since the beginning of Christianity.

Mar Toma Chaldean Catholic Productions, a division of the Eastern Catholic Re-Evangelization Center, led by the St. Thomas Chaldean Catholic Diocese of the Eastern United States, produced “Marked: The Untold Story of the Iraqi Christians.”

“This documentary shares the untold stories of our persecuted brothers and sisters as well as the history of Christians in Iraq,” Bishop Francis said in a press release. “We encourage everyone to see this film featuring our people who have been marked.”

The low budget (less than $30,000) movie made mostly by volunteers will debut during Holy Week. The premiere will be 7 p.m. Wednesday, March 23, at the Maple Theatre, 4135 W. Maple Road, Bloomfield Township.
