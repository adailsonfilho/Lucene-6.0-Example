Fullmetal Alchemist Live-Action Movie Announced

The wildly-popular anime and manga series Fullmetal Alchemist is getting a live-action film adaptation.

According to Livedoor News (translation via Tokyo Otaku Mode), the movie will release sometime next summer and star Yamada Ryosuke as FMA's leading man and beloved alchemist, Edward Elric. In addition to being a member of the pop idol group Hey!Say!JUMP, Yamada starred in the live-action adaptation of Assassination Classroom.


The Fullmetal Alchemist manga -- written and illustrated by Hiromu Arakawa -- ran from 2001 to 2010 and received two anime TV series adaptations, as well as two animated films.

Fullmetal Alchemist is one of many popular anime properties making the jump to live-action, as an American-made Death Note movie is currently in the works, as well as a Ghost in the Shell film starring Scarlett Johansson, which is on track to open in theaters next March. IGN recently spoke to James Wan about his planned adaptation of Robotech, which will focus primarily on the first arc of the show and largely resemble the classic anime Macross.
