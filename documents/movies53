Movie Star Chris Pratt Raises Huge Cross on Easter Sunday

Actor Chris Pratt stood out once again from the rest of the Hollywood crowd on Easter Sunday when he carried an enormous cross up a hill and erected it at the top.

The star’s Instagram account features photos documenting the pilgrimage up the hill including picking the spot and cementing the simple cross in the ground.

Pratt, 36, a dedicated American as well as a man of deep faith, has been outspoken from time to time about his Christian faith especially after the nearly miraculous birth of his son Jack, who was born nine weeks early at 3 pounds, 12 ounces and had to stay a month in the NICU. Pratt and his wife, actress Anna Faris prayed by their son’s bedside for weeks.

“It restored my faith in God, not that it needed to be restored, but it really redefined it,” he told People Magazine at the time. “The baby was so beautiful to us and I look back at the photos of him and it must have been jarring for other people to come in and see him, but to us he was so beautiful and perfect.”

The moment he taught his then two-year-old son the Pledge of Allegiance was captured on film last year.

The Jurassic World star is working on Guardians of the Galaxy 2, which is scheduled for release on May 5, 2017.
