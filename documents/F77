Angelina Jolie mobbed as she visits Greek refugee camp

Angelina Jolie tells press to "back up" when she is caught in a media scrum while talking to two refugee children

A day after visiting refugees in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, U.N. special envoy Angelina Jolie travelled to Greece on Wednesday to highlight the plight of war-fleeing families stuck in the country.
Jolie visited the temporary offices of U.N. refugee agency UNHCR at the main port of Piraeus near Athens, which has become a makeshift camp for some 4,000 refugees and migrants sleeping in tents on the docks.
Scores of onlookers stood outside the agency's offices to see the Hollywood actress, clapping and cheering when she appeared.

Jolie greeted children and asked the throng of reporters, cameramen and photographers to be more "thoughtful" as she tried to speak with them.
In the clip, Jolie is heard repeatedly asking the media to "back up" as it's "not safe for the children."

"I'm here to learn and speak with you and the agencies and the government to learn what is happening, ok?," Jolie told one boy. "Try to stay strong."
According to a UNHCR press release, Jolie is visiting Greece "to reinforce efforts by UNHCR and the Greek government to step up the emergency response to the deteriorating humanitarian situation".
