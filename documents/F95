Tech eases Syrians' trauma in Jordanian refugee camp

The thousands of dusty shops and houses do not at first seem like a place where technology would thrive.
But the Zaatari refugee camp near the Syrian border in Jordan houses a vibrant community of makers.
The majority of the residents are from the Syrian city of Daraa, commonly called the cradle of the revolution for the role it played in early anti-government protests.
The camp was formed four years ago when people fled the war across the border. Now, more than 80,000 people are estimated to live in Zaatari.
Despite the incredible hardships many have faced, there is a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit here.
