The Number of Movies on Netflix Is Dropping Fast

We’re now many years removed from the halcyon days of Netflix’s robust movie streaming library. Even still, the company’s digital catalog continues to shrink.

According to a report by AllFlicks, Netflix had 6,494 movies and 1,609 TV shows in its U.S. catalog in January 2014. As of this week, it has 4,335 movies and 1,197 shows. That’s a 33% dip in films and a 26% drop in television shows in a bit more than two years.

Netflix didn’t respond to TIME’s request for comment.
