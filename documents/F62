Taxpayers pay as refugees flee hellish foreign camps to find a dump in Syracuse

Syracuse, NY -- There's no heat or water in the dead of winter. Urine and feces dirty the hallways. Children go to school scarred by bedbug bites. Drug dealers take refuge inside busted doors.

This is what America looks like for dozens of refugees, who fled war and persecution to find a North Side apartment complex that is no refuge.

And U.S. taxpayers are footing the bill, paying thousands of dollars in rents each month to owners who haven't consistently paid water bills, maintained the property or provided adequate security.

That's according to a class-action lawsuit filed in February on behalf of more than 40 Somali refugees living at the Kimton Apartments, 1313 Butternut St., for years known as "Little Mo" after the Somali capital of Mogadishu. The lawsuit argues the problems are so big that they affect everyone living in the building.

Tenants "came to this country with the promise of a new life, where they and their children would be safe," lawyer Josh Cotter wrote in the lawsuit. "Upon their arrival, they found their new home is not much better than the refugee camps they just left."

The three-story, 25,500-square-foot apartment complex was built 50 years ago in-between two houses. It sits across the street from Schiller Park, between Park Street and Butternut Circle.

A recent tour of the building revealed dangerous living conditions -- including a hole in a staircase --Â“ cockroaches scurrying across kitchens and bathrooms, leaky tubs, broken windows and boarded up, vacant apartments.

Families who spoke to Syracuse.com through a translator described helplessness at getting problems fixed. We don't pay rent, they said, how do we fight for heat or safety?

Tax money goes to pay the $350-a-month or more rent for most residents.

Two mothers here less than a year said that because they don't speak the language and aren't working yet, they felt no power to make things better.

"If I am a refugee, I don't know where I have to go to get things fixed," said Sahni Omar, a grandmother who spent six years in a Somali refugee camp. Her 22-year-old daughter's arms are scarred by bedbug bites.

Omar looked around her sparse -- but tidy -- apartment and sighed. "African houses are more beautiful than American houses," she said.

Somali refugees come to America fleeing decades of civil war after the failed U.S. mission in Mogadishu in 1993, portrayed in part in the movie "Black Hawk Down." Refugee camps without sanitation and controlled by informal militias formed in Kenya and elsewhere. Toilets are holes in the ground and health care is scarce. Fleeing Somalis have created the largest refugee camp in the world, Dadaab, with a population of a half-million people, in northern Kenya.

Very few Somali refugees make it to America. Because most don't speak English, they are dependent on others to advocate for them.

Who runs this place?

Cotter isn't sure who's behind the building's owner, "Olena Butternut LLC," which has a California mailing address. The lawyers couldn't find the actual owner. A lawyer identified on state records as representing the company did not return calls seeking comment.

Syracuse officials would not reveal if they know the person or persons behind the LLC.

The property management company that handles the apartment building is owned by a well-connected Syracuse man, John St. Denis, who is a donor to Catholic Charities, the refugee resettlement agency.

St. Denis made headlines last year for running a collection agency so bad he's barred by the state attorney general from ever opening another debt collection business. Legal Services of Central New York, where Cotter works, also sued St. Denis's collection agency around the same time as the AG's office. (Legal Services is a non-profit that represents those who cannot afford lawyers.)

St. Denis has been recognized for philanthropy: a city park's football field is named after St. Denis' defunct company, Med-Rev. And a 2013 newsletter from Catholic Charities featured a photo of St. Denis and his friend, Syracuse Police Chief Frank Fowler, with a caption thanking St. Denis for his "remarkable generosity" toward people in need.

It doesn't appear St. Denis's company, CNY Property Management Inc., has gotten favorable treatment: Catholic Charities had been resettling refugees into that building years before St. Denis's management company took over, said Catholic Charities Executive Director Mike Melara.

The Butternut Street complex isn't St. Denis' only problem property. Hiscock Legal Aid, which provides help to tenants being evicted, reported 21 different cases of alleged substandard living conditions at St. Denis's other properties, ranging from rats to sewage backups.

His company website recently went offline. Before then, it featured a photo of the Manhattan skyline with the headline: "Property Managers in Syracuse, New York."

Recently, Catholic Charities has apparently stopped paying rent because of the conditions. That has meant tenants are now getting eviction notices from the property manager. If rent isn't paid in three days, "the landlord will commence summary proceedings to evict you," according to one notice sent to Mohmed Ahmed.

But state law allows tenants to refuse to pay rent if the landlord doesn't provide adequate housing.

How bad is it?

One mother, Dal Ayed, 36, said in the lawsuit she does not feel safe leaving the apartment because trespassers hang out in the common area doing drugs. Her children go to school covered in bedbug bites, stepping over drug paraphernalia on the way out, she said.

In February, the apartment complex was in the news when a 32-year-old resident, Sahlah Ridgeway, was shot and killed by police outside the building when officers responded to a drug complaint. Police said she confronted officers with a sawed-off shotgun.

Another mother, Hamida Dhere, 57, and her four children spent more than a week without heat in early January, the lawsuit said. All told, six apartments were deemed unfit Jan. 6 because of the lack of heat, the lawsuit states.

Cotter said tenants have told him the conditions are actually worse than a refugee camp: no water, no heat and no security.

The lawyer had his own visceral reaction to the vermin he saw while investigating the complaints.

"If cockroaches are coming out in the middle of the day..." he said, leaving the rest up to the imagination.

Syracuse.com has toured the building twice in the past five months. A photographer in November described drug users in a stairwell, broken locks on exterior doors, filthy and worn carpets on stairways, a kitchen full of cockroaches and garbage in the common areas.

Many of those problems remained during a second visit last week. One mother, Roda Ismail, recalled bundling up in blankets this winter when the heat went out. Cockroaches and rats infest her apartment.

Ismail said she's thankful to live here despite the problems. "Everything else is good, but the home looks bad," she said.

The lawsuit appears to be working: Repairs are being made after six months of neglect, Cotter said. The water is on after two temporary shutoffs. Sporadic heat shutoffs have ended. Workers have started fixing the broken stoves, sinks, showers and toilets (but a tour showed there's more work to do). There's a lock on the front door.

An exterminator is due to go through the apartment soon, Cotter said.

How did this happen?

Somali refugees have been resettled to 1313 Butternut St. for roughly five years, about three years before the current owner and property manager took over.

That's according to Catholic Charities, which has a government contract to resettle refugees.

The building was attractive because it could hold many large families and was centrally located in Syracuse's burgeoning North Side refugee community. Before putting refugees there, Catholic Charities inspected the building, Melara said.

St. Denis' company didn't start managing the property until April 2014, Melara said. The property had been sold from one anonymous company, Butternut Street Properties LLC, to another, Olena Butternut LLC, in October 2013, according to property records. The price was $580,000.

Catholic Charities didn't see major issues with the building until late fall or early of 2015, Melara said. Before then, the agency had met with property management to discuss the need for better security and minor fixes. Conditions appeared to improve after that meeting, Melara said.

But by November, conditions had deteriorated again and the water was temporarily shut off the first time. Around that time, Catholic Charities stopped moving families into the building.

Things became more serious when the heat was shut off for periods in January and February, Melara said. Catholic Charities notified the city codes department and legal services, spurring the lawsuit.

Despite the worsening condition, many families wanted to stay in hopes things got better, Melara said. The only other option was scattering to different places, breaking up the community of Somalis.

That changed when the building flooded in February. At that point, some residents wanted to move out. That process is ongoing, Melara said.

Melara said it was "odd and unusual" for one of St. Denis' properties to be in such bad repair. Catholic Charities houses other clients -- but no refugees -- in other properties he manages or owns without problems.

"Overall, our relationship has been positive," Melara said.

But he called the conditions at 1313 Butternut St. "really troublesome."

"In this particular case, we just did not seem to be able to get the problems resolved," Melara said. "I haven't sat down and talked to (St. Denis) about what's going on."

That said, Catholic Charities has remained in communication with St. Denis's management company, Melara said, and pointed to the recent repairs as progress.

"We're aware right now a lot of movement in terms of repairing the building: roof repair, other repairs," he said. "There's a new maintenance person onsite. There's a lot of activity trying to fix the building, make it more habitable."

Work continues to move some refugees to new apartments, Melara said. But "there's still kind of a mixed mind" about leaving Little Mo, he said.

"It appears some want to stay in the building provided the repairs are completed," he said. "We want to help them live wherever they can be safe and secure."
