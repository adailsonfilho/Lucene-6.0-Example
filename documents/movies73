It might not be beach weather in most parts of the U.S. this week, but the cast of Baywatch is breaking out their swimsuits. Filming on the reboot of the ’90s TV series started Monday, star Dwayne Johnson announced in an Instagram post Sunday.

“This squad has been working extremely hard for months for these roles — the time has come — we start shooting TOMORROW,” he captioned a photo of the cast. “Let’s roll and bring the world some beach fun.”

Of course Zac Efron is sporting a “Bae Watch” pullover in the shot, proving he can cover up his abs, make corny jokes, and still be damn near perfect.

Though Priyanka Chopra — who joined the Baywatch cast last week as the film’s villain — won’t be on set for Day 1 of shooting (she noted her absence when sharing Johnson’s photo on her account), the Quantico actress sent her costars well wishes.

“Good luck for Tom#Baywatch Squad!” Chopra wrote on Instagram Sunday. “Play while the cat’s away!! C u soon @alexannadaddario@zacefron @therock @kellyrohrbach@ilfenator @thejonbass”

Johnson will star as an experienced lifeguard who teams with a newcomer (Efron) to defend the beach. Billions actress Ilfenesh Hadera will play his love interest, with Kelly Rohrbach filling the role held by Pamela Anderson in the original series. Alexandra Daddario takes on the female lead role of Summer, which Johnson promised she will make “iconic for the world to enjoy.”

Seth Gordon (Horrible Bosses) directs, with Beau Flynn and Ivan Reitman producing. The Baywatch reboot is currently set for release on May 19, 2017.
