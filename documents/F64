Vanderbilt, nonprofits reach out to refugees

With refugees a constant topic of discussion among presidential candidates, Tennessee lawmakers and European leaders, local organizations continue to persevere with new strategies to engage the refugees who make Nashville home.

"There seems to be a disconnect sometimes from resources and people," said Shea Davis, a student at Vanderbilt University's Peabody College of Education and Human Development. "That happens a lot in social services."

Davis created the university's Refugee Awareness Week, which ended in Saturday's International Family Fair. The event invited representatives from local organizations and services catering to Nashville's refugees.

Most families discover the Center for Refugees and Immigrants in Tennessee (CRIT) through word of mouth, but the nonprofit hopes to go out to the community in person, including those along Nolensville Road and Arabic-speaking markets and mosques said Dandrea Alexander, director of the after school program.

"Just kind of get our face out there so people can put a face to the organization," Alexander said. "We are passionate about this and not just putting flyers out there."

CRIT moved from Murfreesboro Road to a site off Harding Place to be closer to the refugee communities.

While refugees find safety all over the world, locally, some Tennessee Republicans are looking to move forward on a resolution that would require the state to sue the federal government for noncompliance of the Refugee Act of 1980.
