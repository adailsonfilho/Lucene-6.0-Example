Muslim Student Association ‘Showdown’ Raises $16.5K to Aid Syrian Refugees

More than 200 Muslim students from 19 Texas universities attended an annual Muslim Student Association (MSA) Showdown during which they raised $16,442 for relief efforts for Syrian refugees.

The 10th annual MSA Showdown held at University of Texas at Arlington (UTA) featured Muslim students from UT-Austin, UT-San Antonio, UT-Dallas, University of North Texas, Texas A&M, and other schools, reports The Shorthorn, UT-Arlington’s student newspaper.

The event – called Project Sadaqa – was held for three days over this past weekend to aid Islamic Relief USA. Some of the events of the Showdown are sports or arts related, while others are focused specifically on Islam. One event – called Tajweed – is the recitation of the Quran, Islam’s holy book.
