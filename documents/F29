The unique challenges of being a young, female Syrian refugee

The 14-year-old Syrian refugee is beaming. Just a few months ago, she spoke no English and this is a triumphant moment.

Hanan, who fled Damascus with her parents and two brothers in 2013, has long felt like an outsider in Lebanon. She lives in a Palestinian camp with her mother and father; the two brothers she adores emigrated to Germany and Dubai to seek work. 

The fact that Hanan can express herself in English is not just an exciting accomplishment â€” it's also a way for her to fit into a Lebanese school, where the ability to speak French and English is important. 

This is just one of many happy developments in Hanan's life since she began attending a community center that provides learning opportunities as well as psychological and social support for young, weary refugees. 

A critical approach in humanitarian aid
While both teenage boys and girls use the centers, there is a unique focus on identifying and engaging young female refugees, who often remain isolated at home once they settle in a new country. 

Their parents may keep them near as a form of protection in a new and unknown environment, or rely on them to perform household tasks. In some cases, they may marry older men and quickly become young mothers. 

The centers are officially known as Bussma, an Arabic word that means fingerprint. They are operated by Mercy Corps, a global humanitarian organization, and managed by local partners.
