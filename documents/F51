Calais camp demolitions 'forcing more refugees to make crossing to UK'

Desperate refugees are taking greater risks to get to Britain, charity workers warn, after lorries packed with people stopped in Kent

The demolition of refugee camps in Calais has caused an increase in the number of asylum seekers trying to cross illegally into Britain in recent weeks, aid workers in the French port city have claimed.

On Monday and again on Wednesday lorries packed with refugees were stopped by police in Kent triggering alarm about the strength of security checks at the British border with France and Belgium following the Brussels attacks.

A lorry was stopped at a business park near Dartford Crossing on Monday with 21 Iranian and Iraqi adults and five children inside. Two days later, 24 men, one woman and a boy, were found in the back of a refrigerated truck in Canterbury.

Less than half of lorries coming from Calais, Dunkirk and the Eurotunnel terminal at Coquelles are fully screened by UK immigration officials, according to the Immigration Services Union (ISU), whose members staff the UK borders.

Earlier this month French authorities restarted the dismantling of parts of the “Jungle” camp where an estimated 3,500 people were living. Many of those left behind fear their shelters will be next and are taking greater risks to cross into the UK.

“There has been a big increase in the numbers crossing since the second eviction of the camp which finished last Wednesday,” said Olivia Long, a worker with the Calais-based UK charity Help Refugees. “There is a sense of desperation now about getting across the border. There is increased fear of what might come next. People are worried they are going to destroy this half of the ‘Jungle’ in the coming weeks. Some are deciding to spend their savings to get across the border.”
