IDOMENI, GREECE—
As the sun rose over northern Greece Saturday and the damp mist slid away, refugees, mostly Syrians and Iraqis, lit fires again in muddy fields and prepared for another day of struggle — of foraging for food, queuing for toilets and wondering if the Macedonians would open the border or would instead continue to block their passage into Europe.

The adults roused themselves, and the sprawling makeshift refugee camp came alive with bleary-eyed children.

For days now most of the children have gone unwashed — there are only a handful of washing facilities available for a burgeoning population of asylum-seekers that U.N. officials here say numbers 12,000 people.

Workers from the French charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders), the real driving force of relief efforts at Idomeni, acknowledge the facilities are inadequate and are urging other international non-profits to provide more assistance in the face of insufficient support from Greek and European authorities.
