Fuel leak led to Predator drone crash in Iraq last year

A fuel leak led to the crash last year of an unmanned MQ-1B Predator drone — the day after its engine was replaced, the Air Force said in an accident report released Thursday.

The Predator's fuel leak led to complete engine failure while flying a classified combat support mission June 22, 2015, Air Combat Command said. ACC did not say where it crashed, aside from saying it was in U.S. Central Command's area of responsibility. But last year, U.S. Air Forces Central Command said it lost a Predator in southeastern Iraq that day, and said it was not due to enemy fire.

The report said the engine had been replaced the day before the crash, and it was its first flight since the engine replacement. All maintenance inspections had been performed and documented, the report said. The report from the accident investigation board concluded that a fuel leak in the engine compartment — identified by a rapid loss in fuel pressure — ignited and damaged the drone's electrical system, data link and flight control systems, which led to engine failure.

Because no wreckage was recovered from the crash site, the report said investigators could not determine the root cause of the fuel leak.

The report did not blame the pilot, sensor operator or crew, or conclude weather was a factor. It said there was no evidence to suggest any human factors contributed to the crash.

The crash cost the government $4.66 million, ACC said, but there were no injuries or other damage to government or private property.

The Predator was from the 432nd Wing at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada. Its crew was assigned to the 20th Reconnaissance Squadron at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.
