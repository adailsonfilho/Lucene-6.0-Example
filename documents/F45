Universities Build a 'Connected Learning' Network for Refugees

In Kakuma refugee camp north-west Kenya, around a dozen students are sitting in a white pre-fab learning hub the size of a lorry container, with their backs to their computers, having a discussion.

The hub is cramped but it is one of the few institutions providing post-secondary education in the camp, which is home to 180,000 refugees and asylum seekers living in rows of huts on the dry dusty landscape.

On the roof of the hub is a row of solar panels to power the computers and the air-conditioning system, vital for the learners but also important for maintaining computers in the extreme climate of these lowlands where temperatures can exceed 40 degrees.

This is the InZone-University of Geneva learning hub, which provides virtual courses and allows enrolled students to interact with students from around the world and learn through collaboration. 

This type of arrangement – gathering students in a single place to learn together but using online courses and a mixture of online tutoring and face to face tutoring – is called “connected learning” and has been pioneered in refugee settings by a number of universities and partnerships of universities for a number of years. 

“The case for using connected learning is strong,” says Barbara Moser-Mercer, director of InZone, “because there is both a social component as well as an individual private component to learning.
