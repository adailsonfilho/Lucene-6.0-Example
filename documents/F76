EU acting like ‘human trafficker’ of refugees, says Austrian minister

Foreign minister Sebastian Kurz says restoring Dublin and Schengen agreements must be priority

Austria’s foreign minister has accused the European Union of “acting like a human trafficker” by ushering refugees straight to the centre of the continent.

Speaking exclusively to the Observer before Monday’s crucial EU-Turkey summit, Sebastian Kurz said that “in Greece refugees are being waved through to the heart of Europe. That is simply unacceptable in the long run. The European Union cannot act like a human trafficker.” Restoring the Dublin and Schengen agreements, he said, had to be a priority at the meeting between the EU leaders and Turkey.

Austria has emerged as the leader of a rebel alliance of central European and west Balkan states that have thwarted German chancellor Angela Merkel’s strategy for an EU-wide solution to the refugee crisis – a remarkable turnaround from last summer when Austria’s chancellor, Werner Faymann, had strongly supported Merkel’s open-border stance.

Austria received 85,500 applications for asylum in 2015, the third highest number of applications per capita in Europe after Hungary and Sweden. But diplomatic tensions between the countries have risen since Austria called what the German media has described as a “putsch-like meeting” on migration in Vienna, to which both Germany and Greece were not invited. Macedonia’s decision to tighten its border with Greece, allowing only Syrians and Iraqis to pass through into the EU, has created tumultuous scenes along its border fence.
