Infant Dies of Chemical Effects; 144 Killed in Iraq

Thousands participated in Shi’ite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr’s Friday sit-in. The demonstrators forced their way through barricades and even cut barbed wire to reach the walls of the Green Zone. The sit-in is expected to last several days. However, some of those calling for change are unhappy that the cleric co-opted the original reform movement.

At least 144 were killed and ten were wounded:

A six-month-old child died on Thursday from the effects of last week’s chemical attack on Taza.

In Baghdad, a blast killed one person and wounded eight more. Security forces killed 48 militants in several operations.

A bomb in Zaghniya wounded two people, one of them a militiaman.
