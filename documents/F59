Up to 3,000 people arrive from Libya to Tunisia every day, while Tunisia takes in more than 450,000 Libyan refugees, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said.

UNITED NATIONS (Sputnik) – Speaking at a press conference with Tunisian Prime Minister Habib Essid on Tuesday, Ban thanked the country and its people for "their generosity to accommodate more than 450,000 Libyan refugees."

"And I understand that even at this moment, every day, 2,000 to 3,000 Libyans are crossing the border and settling in this country," Ban said in a speech as quoted by the UN press service.

Libya has been engulfed in conflict since the 2011 overthrow of long-term leader Muammar Gaddafi by Western-backed Islamic extremists and opposition factions, and the subsequent civil war.
