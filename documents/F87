‘Europe gives money but only cares about one thing: keeping refugees out’

Millions of Syrians stuck in Turkey feel the €3bn offered by Europe as part of an ‘action plan’ will be of little benefit to them

Sitting around the table in a small shop room, several women and men discuss plans for a Women’s Day celebration. Children chatter in Turkish and Arabic. Bags stuffed with garments sit in a corner, children’s drawings hang in the windows.

Ok-Der, a neighbourhood association founded to inform residents about their rights to resist a planned urban renewal scheme, now mostly focuses on the needs of refugees who live in the area: food packages, clothes, assistance in navigating the healthcare and education systems. Volunteers also offer English and art classes for children.

None of the Syrian refugees and the volunteers around the table believes that they will benefit from the joint action plan that EU member states and Turkey will discuss on Monday. They know that the plan primarily aims to curb the refugee flow to Europe. Under it, the EU has pledged €3bn and political concessions to Turkey in exchange for increased border patrols and a crackdown on people smugglers.

“That money is not for us,” says Suhaila, 25, from Aleppo, the mother of two children. “All they care about is how to keep us out of Europe.”

About 2,500 people have reached Greece from Turkey every day since the deal was struck at a summit in Brussels last November and EU leaders are anxious to reduce that number before spring when more people are likely to attempt the perilous crossing over the Aegean Sea.

Turkey has about 2.6 million Syrian refugees, the largest such population in the world, and the EU wants them to remain there. European leaders, some of whom want to push the number of arrivals down to zero, have also urged for the possibility of sending people back to Turkey.
