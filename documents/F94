The Brussels terror attacks prompted Poland to rethink its already unenthusiastic position on accepting asylum seekers and stop resettlements.

“I say very clearly that I see no possibility at this time of immigrants coming to Poland,” Prime Minister Beata Szydło said on Wednesday.

Her predecessor Ewa Kopacz had agreed to take 7,000 asylum seekers of the 160,000 being allocated across the bloc, buckling under strong pressure from Germany and other EU countries.

Szydło and the ruling right-wing Law and Justice party were opposed to the decision, but agreed to honor it after taking power in October.

The latest attacks have toughened Poland’s position.

“Until procedures to verify the refugees are put in action, we cannot accept them,” Rafał Bochenek, a government spokesman, told reporters. “The priority of the government is the safety of Poles … We understand the previous government … signed commitments which bind our country. We cannot allow a situation in which events taking place in the countries of Western Europe are carried over to the territory of Poland.”
