Lara Setrakian is building a media empire

Lara Setrakian is 33 and ready to change the news industry. Again.

Three years ago, she co-founded News Deeply, a media company centered on subject-based deep dives into major news stories.

The Syria-focused edition of her site emerged out of nowhere in December 2012 to become one of the go-to resources for information and context on the growing conflict. It followed that up with another site that focused on the Ebola outbreak in Africa. Then came the Arctic.

Skirting the sound-bite ethos that has long ruled international news reporting in the U.S., Setrakian found demand, building a following among an influential group of policy wonks, politicians, academics and activists.

“We designed for the wonks and invited everybody else to the party,” Setrakian says.
