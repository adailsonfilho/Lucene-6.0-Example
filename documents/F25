Syrian refugees mark first Easter in Canada with Mass in Outremont

hristians around the world headed to Easter Mass on Sunday, but in Montreal one very special mass welcomed 250 Syrian refugee families to mark the most important date in the Christian calendar in Canada for the first time.

"It is the first Easter for them in Canada and we would like to make it as joyous as possible and welcome them in Montreal and in Canada," said Antranik Sirinyan, chairman of the St. Gregory the Illuminator Armenian Church in Outremont.

"Of course it’s difficult, but it needs time and in time I think everything will be okay," said refugee Shoghig Kochakejian. "I’m happy because we have a great community here and we’re having fun, but you still think that we have relatives and friends still in Syria, so it’s happiness but it’s not complete."

The gesture was met with gratitude and appreciation from the newly-arrived refugees, with many thanking the parishioners for making a hard transition to Canadian life that much easier.

"I’m very thankful that Canada and Montreal gave us the opportunity to be here,” said refugee Hovesp Bogossian. “We’re happy to be serving our church and serving the community."
