Death of the Jungle: Incredible aerial images reveal how the Calais slum is now just bare earth after makeshift homes were flattened by bulldozers during the eviction of thousands of refugees

Migrant camp known as the Jungle was once home to an estimated 6,000 people, with shops and even a nightclub
French court gave permission for it to be cleared last month and hundreds of makeshift homes are now all gone
Pictures from above, before and after, show how huge swathes of the camp have been totally cleared in recent weeks 

It was home to more than 6,000 migrants hoping to smuggle their way into Britain.
But huge swathes of the notorious ‘Jungle’ camp in Calais are no more after it was bulldozed by the French authorities.
The squalid shantytown on land close to the ferry terminal had grown into a tented city with more than a dozen shops, restaurants, a hotel and even a nightclub.
