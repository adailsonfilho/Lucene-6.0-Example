Christopher Nolan's next project is a WWII movie

After mastering superhero movies with “The Dark Knight,” flying through time and space in “Interstellar,” and messing with everyone’s minds in “Inception” and “Memento,” director Christopher Nolan is taking on a major genre currently missing from his resume — a period war drama.

According to Deadline, Nolan’s next project, titled “Dunkirk,” will follow the World War II evacuation of the French beach town of the same name.
