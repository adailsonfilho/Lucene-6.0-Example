Iraq stadium bombing death toll climbs to 41

The suicide bombing, claimed by Daesh, struck Friday during a soccer match in the small stadium in the city of Iskanderiyah.

BAGHDAD—Iraqi officials say the death toll from a suicide bombing at a soccer stadium that was claimed by Daesh has climbed to 41, with another 105 people wounded.
The security and public health officials provided the updated toll Saturday on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief reporters.
The bombing took place Friday during a match in the small stadium in the city of Iskanderiyah, 50 kilometres from the capital, Baghdad. Daesh claimed the attack, saying it had targeted Shiite militiamen.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon offered his condolences on Saturday to the families and friends of the 41 people killed, adding that the "the international community stands with Iraqis in horror and outrage."
Speaking during an official visit to Iraq Saturday, Ban said that the battle against Daesh must comply with international law, noting continued reports of arbitrary arrests and killings in Daesh-liberated areas.
The extremist group has lost ground in recent months in Iraq and Syria, but has struck back with a series of large attacks targeting civilians. Daesh also claimed this week’s attacks in Brussels, which killed 31 people.
The president of the world football federation FIFA, Gianni Infantino, also offered his condolences to those killed. "Around the world, football unites people. It is a very sad day, when people, going to a match together, become the victims of such violence," he said in a statement.
