Syrian refugees 'drag paedophile to police' after he was allegedly found attacking 7-year-old at refugee camp

Two Syrian refugees have spoken about how they handed over a suspected paedophile to police officers, after they allegedly caught him trying to rape a seven-year-old girl.

Bashar Al-Ali, 29, from Deir ez-Zor, and Dlar Sedo, 24, from Aleppo, told the Daily Mail they were in the Idomeni camp in Greece when they heard the girl's father shout: "He's trying to rape my daughter."

They rushed towards the woodland to find the Afghan refugee allegedly trying to undress the girl behind a row of temporary toilets.

After grabbing the man, they marched him to the police, who arrested him.

In an interview with the Daily Mail, Mr al-Ali said: "The Afghan man took her behind the toilets and then she started to scream.

"I ran over and saw that he was trying to remove her t-shirt and trousers. I grabbed him and started kicking him."
