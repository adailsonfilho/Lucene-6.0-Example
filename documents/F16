Does Tammy Duckworth really want to accept 200,000 refugees from Syria?

"Tammy Duckworth wants to accept 20 times more refugees than the president — 200,000.”

Sen. Mark Kirk (Ill.) is one of the most endangered Republicans in the Senate, facing a tough race against Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) in a blue state. Kirk, who worked in the State Department and the military, is especially challenging Duckworth — who lost her legs as a helicopter pilot in the Iraq war — on national security issues. In this ad, he suggests that she is putting American lives at risk by wanting to accept 200,000 refugees from Syria.

A reader asked us to examine this ad, noting that Kirk regularly says in speeches that Duckworth wants to accept 200,000 refugees from Syria. The reader wanted to know whether this is indeed the case.

If the figure “200,000 refugees” seems familiar to readers, it’s because we have regularly criticized Donald Trump for falsely claiming that President Obama wants to admit that many refugees from Syria. In reality, Obama has committed to accepting only 10,000 refugees from Syria. The administration also committed to accepting 185,000 refugees from all countries in 2016 and 2017.

The ad, to its credit, recognizes that reality, saying, “Duckworth wants to accept 20 times more refugees than the president.”

But the Duckworth campaign is adamant that she has never said that she wants to accept 200,000 refugees from Syria. The campaign points to a congressional letter, spearheaded by Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), that she signed in September that called for accepting 100,000 refugees from Syria and 200,000 overall just in 2016, based on a request from Refugee Council USA. That is still far more than Obama — 10 times as much — but it is half the figure cited in the ad.

The letter, which also called for additional security checks, was issued Sept. 11, 2015, a day after Obama said he would accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in 2016. But the letter appears to have had little effect. Just nine days later, the administration announced its plan to accept 185,000 refugees overall over two years.

Okay, now let’s fast forward to a news conference held in November, which is from where the Kirk campaign got the video clip of Duckworth saying, “I signed on for 200,000 refugees.”

Frustratingly, there appears to be no full audio or video of the questions and answers at the news conference. Even the Duckworth campaign claims it has no audio, though it is standard operating procedure for campaigns — even those for school boards — to record every utterance made by a candidate.

The Fact Checker has never encountered a Senate campaign that claimed it did not have audio of a recent news conference. Duckworth spokesman Matt McGrath said it is SOP to record events, but it did not happen in this case.  “We don’t have one on this,” he said. “And we’re not disputing what she said, we’re disputing the context.”
