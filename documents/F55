Australian government spends $6m of taxpayers' money on anti-refugee film

The Australian government has spent $6 million of taxpayers' money on a straight-to-TV movie intended to discourage refugees from claiming asylum in Australia.

Journey depicts a group of people from Afghanistan who pay people-smugglers to help them across the Indian Ocean. However, following a series of misadventures the boat is caught in a storm. 

In the closing scenes, a man can be seen struggling in deep water with the corpse of his dead, toddler-aged daughter as a boat abandons them in the distance.

Other relatives have already drowned on-camera in preceding scenes, with one man committing suicide by removing his life jacket. The struggling man is seen surrounded by the bodies of drowned and drowning people, and the action cuts to grieving relatives in Afghanistan. 

The movie has been recorded in Dari, Pashto, Urdu, Arabic and Farsi, but will not be released in English, giving some idea as to the film's target audience.

A Sydney-based film company called Put It Out There Pictures was paid $4.34 million of Australian taxpayers' money to make the film. The company's director, Trudi-Ann Tierney, has previously been involved in the production of pro-war soap operas for Afghan television.

The film was shot on location in three countries. Lapis Communications were then paid $1.63 million to market the picture, suggesting a total budget just shy of $6m. It has already been screened in Pakistan, Iran and Iraq, and will soon be shown in Afghanistan.
