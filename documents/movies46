WHO Julia Roberts

THE MOVIE “Fool Me Once”

THE DEAL Roberts will star in an adaptation of a Harlan Coben novel that arrived in stores just last week, Variety reports. She’ll play Maya, a former special ops pilot whose nanny-cam captures a strange image: her 2-year-old daughter playing with Maya’s recently murdered husband. Roberts is also a producer on the film.
