Refugees rush back to Greek camp amid rumours of open border

Hundreds of hopeful refugees have returned to Greece’s overwhelmed Idomeni camp on the border with Macedonia after rumours that the closed frontier would be forced open.

Greek authorities are trying to evacuate an estimated 11,500 people stranded at the squalid camp after Balkan states slammed shut their borders, cutting off the migrant route to Europe.

By late Sunday morning, about 250 people of all ages had gathered by the railway tracks and the border fence, singing and shouting slogans, in a largely peaceful demonstration watched by bout 50 Greek policemen in riot gear.

“No violence, we just want to cross,” read one banner, while another said: “Freedom of movement is everybody’s right.”

The wave of new arrivals appeared to be triggered by a rumour that international journalists and Red Cross officials would help them force their way across the fence into Macedonia, a young Syrian refugee told the Athens News Agency.

“We heard today that the border will open and we came here to cross,” he said.

“They told us the Red Cross and 500 journalists from all over the world will be with us,” he said, without specifying the source.

Another young Syrian refugee said his sister, who was living in Germany, had read the same claim on the internet and alerted him.

“People have been here for a long time. I think it’s very dangerous to cross, especially for the children, but what should we do?” said 24-year-old Qasim Mosawy from Afghanistan.

Dozens of other people could be seen heading through the fields towards the Idomeni crossing.

“We are trying to step up our information campaign to the refugees. Some people, for reasons we don’t understand, are creating false hope,” said Giorgos Kyritsis, spokesman of the SOMP agency, which is coordinating Athens’ response to the refugee crisis.
