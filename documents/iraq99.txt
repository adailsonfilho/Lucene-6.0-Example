Forces gathering to retake Iraq city of Mosul from beleagured Islamic State jihadists

THE long-anticipated battle to wrest the northern Iraqi city of Mosul from the Islamic State is imminent. The liberation of the second biggest city in Iraq would prove the most defining and morale-boosting moment in the entire war to date, and give new courage that the days of ISIL are numbered.

Recent imagery from the outskirts of Mosul, a city that once held two and a half million people but has dwindled to one million after ISIL seized it in June 2014, suggests things have gone very quiet, with barely a car seen moving.

It is thought that Mosul’s estimated 10,000-strong ISIL force has drawn into the centre of the city, along with the remaining civilian population, as it prepares for a showdown. The population is a mix of ISIL supporters and those who are trapped and will be used as human shields.

Last week, Iraqi aircraft flew over the city and dropped hundreds of thousands of leaflets, advising people that help was finally coming. They told the population that Iraqi forces had been victorious late last year in the battle for Ramadi, east of Baghdad, and advised them to be ready for “the biggest battle”.

This week, the US-led fighters attacked chemical sites near Mosul supposedly used to produce mustard gas. It comes a week after the Pentagon announced it was using cyber interference to block telecommunications within Mosul as it prepares to assist Iraq in retaking Mosul at an undisclosed date, in the immediate future.
