Trainwreck

Amy Schumer takes on romcom clichés and wins in this hilarious Judd Apatow flick

Amy Schumer makes you laugh till it hurts. Proof is in her Comedy Central series, Inside Amy Schumer, with its classic skits on Bill Cosby and whether Schumer is hot enough for TV. Proof positive is in her starring movie debut in Trainwreck. In the lead role and as screenwriter — with director Judd Apatow expertly harnessing her energy, not taming it — Schumer is a whole summer of comic fireworks wrapped in one ballsy package. Or is that sexist? Heads up, guys. Schumer's assault on caveman attitudes hits like a kick in the nut sack.
