German brewer accused of making 'Nazi beer' critical of refugee policy

Röhrl Brewery in Straubing, Bavaria, apologises and withdraws ‘border fence’ beer but says it has no far-right sympathies

A Bavarian brewer has caused outrage in Germany by producing a batch of “border fence” beer that appears to use Nazi symbols to criticise the large number of refugees arriving in the country.

Röhrl Brewery removed the variety from sale this week and apologised for “hurt feelings”, but denied having any sympathy with the far right.

Frank Sillner, the chief executive of the brewery in Straubing, said he had intended the special issue of 2,000 crates to be a commentary on the migration crisis and a reminder of Bavarian values.

The brown label on the 500ml bottles uses Gothic letters for the name “grenzzaun halbe” or “border fence half”, which appears to echo demands from local conservative politicians to seal Germany’s frontiers.

It also says “the homeland needs beer”, while the back of the label features the words “protect”, “defend” and “preserve” alongside virtues such as “diligence”, “loyalty” and “discipline”.

University groups urged people to boycott the brewery, while social media users described the variety as a “Nazi beer”.

They pointed to the retail price per bottle of €0.88 – a number used in neo-Nazi circles for the illegal “Heil Hitler” greeting, because the letter H is the eighth in the alphabet.

The company has insisted that this and the batch’s use-by date of 9 November, the day that marks the 1938 anti-Jewish attack known as Kristallnacht, are a coincidence.
