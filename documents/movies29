Dressing ‘Absolutely Fabulous - The Movie’

LONDON — Costume designer Rebecca Hale created the lavish looks for the cast of the British TV series “Absolutely Fabulous,” which aired on BBC from 1992 to 2012 — and she’s come back for more. Hale has created the wardrobes for the upcoming film, looking to emerging and established British designers to dress every member of a cast that includes Jennifer Saunders, Joanna Lumley and Jane Horrocks.

Here, Hale talks about how dramatically fashion has changed since the first episodes of AbFab aired, and how social media has shaped her creations.

WWD: How did you prep for the movie?

Rebecca Hale: I did an initial mood board and I looked at all the current collections and also the graduate, postgraduate and the arts school shows because I really wanted to incorporate the latest young designers, as well.

WWD: Did you take the actors’ opinions on board?

R.H.: Initially, I spoke to Jennifer [Saunders] and showed her all the mood boards for every character. I wanted it to be essentially about British fashion. I wanted to celebrate British fashion and she was in accordance with that. Then we looked individually at every character.

I then talked to all the actors about the images they liked. You gradually start to build costumes. I went to vintage fairs, looked at old clothes, new clothes, current collections and I approached designers. For Jennifer, although she always used to wear [Christian] Lacroix, we thought it would be great for her to always be either in Vivienne Westwood or Stella McCartney and playing with other designers like Ashish and Henry Holland.
