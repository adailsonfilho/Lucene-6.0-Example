Explore the terrifying house from horror movie Darling in exclusive clip

Writer-director Mickey Keating’s new, Must List-approved horror movie Darling (out in New York on April 1) has a fine supporting cast, which includes Brian Morvant (Pod) and Sean Young (Blade Runner). But there’s no doubt the film has two real stars. The first is actress Lauren Ashley Carter (Jug Face, The Woman) who plays the new caretaker of a large Manhattan house. The second? That would be the house itself, an imposing edifice which becomes ever more spooky as the movie’s plot unfolds.
In a new behind-the-scenes clip, Keating talks about finding, and shooting in, the main location of his film, which expands to other cities April 8 and will also be available to watch on VOD and digital platforms from that date.
