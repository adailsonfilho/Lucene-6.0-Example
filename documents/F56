Tuesday's papers: Finland rebuked on refugees, alcohol law talks, church arson aftermath

A look at Finland's press after the Easter holiday on Tuesday finds that the charity Oxfam has scolded Finland and several other countries for not taking in their "fair share" of Syrian refugees. Government talks on loosening alcohol laws in Finland are underway, but not by much. Parishioners in Ylivieska are still trying to make sense of the arson which destroyed their historic wooden church on Saturday.

The British charity Oxfam has scolded the wealthier countries of the world for not taking their fair share of responsibility for nearly five million Syrian refugees, the newspaper Iltalehti reports.

Though Finland and a handful of other countries have done more than other countries, Oxfam says that Finland still has some catching up to do.

Oxfam named Finland as one of five counties which have already pledged "more than half" of their "fair share" of Syrian refugees. Oxfam calculated the countries' fair share figures according to the size of their economies.

The organisation said that Finland and the countries of Australia, Iceland, Sweden, and New Zealand have pledged more than half of their fair share, but they still need to do more, the paper writes.

According to Oxfam, the rich countries of the world have only resettled 1.39 percent of the five million refugees, "a fraction of the 10 percent of people who need to be urgently offered a safe haven."

The three countries which have made resettlement pledges exceeding their fair share include Canada, Germany and Norway.

At the other end of Oxfam's list are the countries of France, who according to the charity has so far pledged to take four percent, the Netherlands and the United States at seven percent each, Denmark at 15 percent and the United Kingdom which has pledged 22 percent of its "fair share" of Syrian refugees.
