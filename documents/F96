Game of Thrones stars issue appeal to help refugees

Ahead of its hotly anticipated sixth season, "Game of Thrones" cast members have come together to raise awareness on the global refugee crisis.

HBO has partnered with the International Rescue Committee (IRC) to launch the "Rescue Has No Boundaries" campaign, with the hope of raising money for those displaced by natural disasters and conflict.

In a video published over the weekend, the show's cast, led by actress Lena Headey who plays scheming Cersei Lannister, appeal to people across the globe to "rise up" and donate money to the initiative.

"Mass exodus, millions on the move escaping war, famine and destruction. This is no fiction, no fantasy," the cast in the video say.

"Every month, hundreds of thousands flee their homes. Refugees. Families. Children. Struggling to stay alive. Real people, now on the most dangerous journey of all."

Last December, the United Nations revealed that more than 60 million people were likely to have been forcibly displaced worldwide, with the intergovernmental organization saying the Syrian war remained the "single biggest generator of both new refugees and continuing mass internal displacement."
