Refugee families in Burnaby adjust to new life with help of Canadian mentors

A new program in Burnaby, B.C. is helping Syrian refugees by pairing them with a Canadian mentor that can help them understand life and culture in Canada.

The program, offered by the Burnaby School District, has matched seven Arabic-speaking volunteers with 27 recently arrived Syrian refugee families. 

Volunteer mentor Rita Koujian — who arrived in Canada last year as a privately-sponsored Syrian refugee — said the program gives her an opportunity to give back.

Other volunteers in the program have been in Canada for several years. 

Koujian has been paired with several families, including the Al-Abaas family, that arrived in Canada two months ago.

"I introduced them to the school in Burnaby and then I helped them with filling in forms and introducing them to the community," said Koujian.

"[I explained] how transportation works by bus and train, the most reasonable prices for the shops for food." 

Whether it's getting a cell phone contract or learning the concept of recycling, Canadian mentors are helping refugees without English skills, understand life and culture.

The Al-Abaas family has nine children ranging in age from 4 months to 20 years old.
