They aimed to raise awareness about the refugee crisis

George and Amal Clooney recently met with three Syrian refugees in Berlin to listen to their stories and raise awareness about the ongoing migration crisis on the fifth anniversary of the Syrian conflict.

One man talked about being tortured in a political prison, while a mother spoke about hiding with her children in their home during a bombardment that she thought would kill them. The meeting was featured in a video released by the International Rescue Committee on Tuesday.
